# Optimize sql statement
- Create an index on very large tables (>1.000.000) rows
- Use EXIST() instead of COUNT() to find an element in the table
- SELECT fields instead of using SELECT *
- Avoid Subqueries in WHERE Clause
- Avoid SELECT DISTINCT where possible
- Use WHERE Clause instead of HAVING
- Create joins with INNER JOIN (not WHERE)
- Use LIMIT to sample query results
- Use UNION ALL instead of UNION wherever possible
- Use UNION where instead of WHERE ... or ... query.
- Run your query during off-peak hours
- Avoid using OR in join queries
- Choose GROUP BY over window functions
- Use derived and temporary tables
- Drop the index before loading bulk data
- Use materialized views instead of views
- Avoid != or <> (not equal) operator
- Minimize the number of subqueries
- Try to use INNER join as little as possible when you can get the same output using LEFT/RIGHT join.
